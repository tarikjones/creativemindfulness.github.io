        <h1>Technology</h1>
        <h2>Technology is a part of everything we do. While technology provides us with entertainment and make our lives easier, it may be a good idea to limit our usage once in a while.</h2>
        <img src="images/tech.jpg" class="img-responsive col-md-12 img-big" alt="Technology">
        <p>
            In a study from the University of Maryland which banned all forms of technology for 24 hours, the participating students began experiencing withdrawal symptoms after only a few hours. It may sound silly, but if you tried a similar test, chances are you'd feel the same. One student went as far as comparing his dependency to that of a crack-cocaine addict.

            So has this addiction turned us into a bunch of impassive grunts, indifferent to social integration and natural scenery? Do we no longer notice the color of the grass? Are we forever assigned to a Facebook generation that only cares about how cute their profile picture looks? Sadly, the evidence would suggest so.
        </p>
        <h3>Why we should limit technology usage</h3>
        <h4>While it may be a little different, we can still function with less technology.
